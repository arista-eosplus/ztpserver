'''
Allocates a resource from a key/value YAML file (under
DATA_ROOT/resources) that contains a set of resources to be
allocated. Here is an example (DATA_ROOT/resoruces/ip_address):

    192.168.1.1/24: null
    192.168.1.2/24: null

When a resource is allocated within a node definition, the first available
null value will be replaced by the node unique_id.

    192.168.1.1/24: 001c731a2b3c
    192.168.1.2/24: null    

On subsequent attempts to allocate the resource to the same node,
ztpserver will first check to see whether the node has already been
allocated a resource from the pool. If it has, it will reuse the
resource instead of allocating a new one.

In order to free a resource from a pool, simply turn the
valueassociated to it back to ``null``, by editing the resource
file. Alternatively, ``$ztps --clear-resources`` can be used in order
to freeall resources in all file-based resource files.

Definition example:

    actions:
      -
        action: add_config
        attributes:
          url: files/templates/ma1.templates
          variables:
            ipaddress: allocate('mgmt_subnet')
        name: "configure ma1"
