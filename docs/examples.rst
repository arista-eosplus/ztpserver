Example #1
''''''''''

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - name: standard leaf definition
      definition: leaf_template
      node: ABC12345678
      interfaces:
        - Ethernet49: pod1-spine1:Ethernet1/1
        - Ethernet50:
            device: pod1-spine2
            port: Ethernet1/1

In example #1, the topology map would only apply to a node with system ID
equal to **ABC12345678**. The following interface map rules apply:

-  Interface Ethernet49 must be connected to node pod1-spine1 on port
   Ethernet1/1
-  Interface Ethernet50 must be connected to node pod1-spine2 on port
   Ethernet1/1

Example #2
''''''''''

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - name: standard leaf definition
      definition: leaf_template
      node: 001c73aabbcc
      interfaces:
        - any: regex('pod\d+-spine\d+'):Ethernet1/$
        - any:
            device: regex('pod\d+-spine1')
            port: Ethernet2/3

In this example, the topology map would only apply to the node with
system ID equal to **001c73aabbcc**. The following interface
map rules apply:

-  At least one interface interface must be connected to node that matches the regular
   expression 'pod+-spine+' on port Ethernet1/$ (any port on module 1)
-  At least one interface and not the interface which matched in the previous step
   must be connected to a node that matches the regular expression
   'pod+-spine1' on port Ethernet2/3

Example #3
''''''''''

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - name: standard leaf definition
      definition: dc-1/pod-1/leaf_template
      variables:
        - not_spine: excludes('spine')
        - any_spine: regex('spine\d+')
        - any_pod: includes('pod')
      interfaces:
        - Ethernet1: $any_spine:Ethernet1/$
        - Ethernet2: $pod1-spine2:any
        - any: excludes('spine1'):Ethernet49
        - any: excludes('spine2'):Ethernet49
        - Ethernet49:
            device: $not_spine
            port: Ethernet49
        - Ethernet50:
            device: excludes('spine')
            port: Ethernet50

This example pattern could apply to any node that matches the interface
map. In includes the use of variables for cleaner implementation and
pattern re-use.

-  Variable not\_spine matches any node name where 'spine' doesn't
   appear in the string
-  Variable any\_spine matches any node name where the regular
   expression 'spine+' matches the name
-  Variable any\_pod matches any node name where that includes the name
   'pod' in it
-  **Variable any\_pod\_spine combines variables any\_spine and any\_pod
   into a complex variable that includes any name that matches the
   regular express 'spine+' and the name includes 'pod' (not yet
   supported)**
-  Interface Ethernet1 must be connected to a node that matches the
   any\_spine pattern and is connected on Ethernet1/$ (any port on
   module 1)
-  Interface Ethernet2 must be connected to node 'pod1-spine2' on any
   Ethernet port
-  Interface any must be connected to any node that doesn't have
   'spine1' in the name and is connected on Ethernet49
-  Interface any must be connected to any node that doesn't have
   'spine2' in the name and wasn't already used and is connected to
   Ethernet49
-  Interface Ethernet49 matches if it is connected to any node that
   matches the not\_spine pattern and is connected on port 49
-  Interface Ethernet50 matches if the node is connected to port
   Ethernet50 on any node whose name does not contain ‘spine’

Example #4
''''''''''

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - name: sample mlag definition
      definition: mlag_leaf_template
      variables:
        any_spine: includes('spine')
        not_spine: excludes('spine')
      interfaces:
        - Ethernet1: $any_spine:Ethernet1/$
        - Ethernet2: $any_spine:any
    - Ethernet3: none
    - Ethernet4: any
    - Ethernet5:
        device: includes('oob')
        port: any
    - Ethernet49: $not_spine:Ethernet49
    - Ethernet50: $not_spine:Ethernet50

This is a similar example to #3 that demonstrates how an MLAG pattern
might work.

-  Variable any\_spine defines a pattern that includes the word 'spine'
   in the name
-  Variable not\_spine defines a pattern that matches the inverse of
   any\_spine
-  Interface Ethernet1 matches if it is connected to any\_spine on port
   Ethernet1/$ (any port on module 1)
-  Interface Ethernet2 matches if it is connected to any\_spine on any
   port
-  Interface 3 matches so long as there is nothing attached to it
-  Interface 4 matches so long as something is attached to it
-  Interface 5 matches if the node contains 'oob' in the name and is
   connected on any port
-  Interface49 matches if it is connected to any device that doesn't
   have 'spine' in the name and is connected on Ethernet50
-  Interface50 matches if it is connected to any device that doesn't
   have 'spine' in the name and is connected on port Ethernet50

Example #5
''''''''''

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - name: Connected to Spine 2
      definition: spine2
      variables:
        any_spine: includes('spine')
      interfaces:
        - any: $any_spine:regex('Ethernet[45]/\d+\1')

In this case, the pattern matches if `any` local interface is connected to a
device with `spine` in the hostname and to the 4th or 5th slot in the chassis.

Example #6
''''''''''

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - name: old switch
      definition: old-switch
      model: "DCS-7010T-48"
      interfaces:
        - Ethernet49: $uplink:any
    - name: new switch
      definition: new-switch
      model: "DCS-7010TX-48-F"
      interfaces:
        - Ethernet49: $uplink:any

In this case, the two patterns match the same uplink switch on the same
local interface, but with a different model. This will allow to use a
different definition to upload a version of EOS compatible with the device.
