    '''Installs software image on the switch.

    If the current software image is the same as the 'version'
    attribute value, then this action is a no-op.  Otherwise, the
    action will replace the existing software image.

    For dual supervisor systems, the image on the active supervisor is
    used as reference.

    This action is dual-supervisor compatible.

    Args:
        attributes (list): list of attributes; use attributes.get(<ATTRIBUTE_NAME>) to read attribute values
        node (internal): attributes.get('NODE') API: see documentation
        url: path to .swi file
        version: target version of the .swi file.

    Example:
        ::

            -
              action: install_image
              always_execute: true
              attributes:
                url: files/images/vEOS.swi
                version: 4.13.5F
              name: "validate image"
              onstart: "Starting to install image"
              onsuccess: "SUCCESS: 4.13.5F installed"
              onfailure: "FAIL: IM nick@example.com for help"
